          <h1>Tradepost | UX/UI Research &amp; Design</h1>
          <p>
            Tradepost is a concept for an app that aims to provide a quick and
            easy way for users to buy and sell their furniture. This project
            seeks to provide a user-to-user resale app for furniture. With this
            in mind, the app was designed with the goals, motivations, needs,
            and pain points of furniture buyers in mind.
          </p>

          <h3>Defining the problem.</h3>
          <p>
            On Tradepost, users can buy and sell furniture with other users.
            This project was inspired by my own experiences buying and selling
            furniture on Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist. Although I was
            still able to accomplish my goals with these websites, I found
            myself experiencing a lot of frustration, especially with
            encountering dishonest sellers and even scammers at times. It was
            also difficult to find the specific items that I wanted because
            they’re not specialized for furniture. Inspired by my own
            experiences, I designed Tradepost to be a marketplace that’s
            specifically catered to buying and selling furniture.

          <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <img src="/images/tradepost/depop.png" alt="" class="img-fluid" />
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <img
                src="/images/tradepost/offerup.png"
                alt=""
                class="img-fluid"
              />
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            For the competitor analysis, I analyzed OfferUp and Depop. Offerup
            is a resale market with an emphasis on in-person transactions. Depop
            is a popular clothing resale market that implements features of
            social media applications. I decided to evaluate OfferUp because it
            is one of the largest resale markets and Depop because of it’s large
            cultural reach and it’s success in tapping into new trends among
            consumers. These two applications are opposite in terms of their
            execution. OfferUp is very utilitarian and plain, while Depop is
            bold and trendy. I wanted to study what aspects these applications
            got right, and what aspects they got wrong. In order to examine the
            usability of these applications, I conducted a heuristic evaluation
            in order to identify usability problems. I found that OfferUp has
            issues with its layout of images as well as the placement of ads.
            Depop has issues with its efficiency of use.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h3>Competitor Usability Test</h3>
          <p>
            In addition, I also conducted a usability test with OfferUp. Based
            on the findings from my heuristic evaluation, I hoped to evaluate
            the usability of the app by conducting pilot usability testing. I
            also hoped to test the overall effectiveness, efficiency, and
            satisfaction that the app does or does not provide. I wanted to
            uncover any issues that I may have missed in my heuristic
            evaluation. The usability test confirmed and also revealed several
            issues. It confirmed some of the things that I had suspected would
            cause issues, such as the disruptive ads and the difficulty in
            unlisting items. It also revealed several other issues, such as the
            lack of system status while searching as far as shipping vs. pickup
            method, and the fact that notifications persist in the inbox even
            after they’re resolved, which can create confusion.

        <div class="container">
          <h2>User Research</h2>
          <p>
            In order to better understand the motivation, needs, and behaviors
            of users, I conducted two user research studies involving
            interviewing and participatory observation. During the interview, my
            goal was to gain an understanding of user habits, how users utilize
            online market places to meet their goals, and what pain points they
            commonly face. During the participatory observation, I observed a
            user performing two activities: searching and selecting an item, and
            listing an item. The purpose of this activity was to understand
            their process and the logic behind their decision making.<br /><br />
            The interview confirmed to me that facilitating trustworthiness
            between buyers and sellers is important. This is especially relevant
            because most resale markets do not allow refunds, so buyers must
            have confidence in sellers. An aspect that I hadn’t thought of
            before is that feedback and interaction can encourage sellers to
            stay on the platform. Platforms that do not have likes or other
            methods of interaction may be less beneficial, since sellers may be
            more likely to become discouraged.<br /><br />
            Based on these findings, I identified several features that would
            address certain needs and pain points of users:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Filters</strong>–Allow users to filter by type, color,
              condition, price, and location.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simple listing process</strong>–A simple listing process
              with pre-set categories and the ability to copy prior listings
              would make listing easier and more convenient.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User profiles and reviews</strong>–his creates greater
              trustworthiness.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <h2>UX Storytelling</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of UX Storytelling is to help designers understand and
            empathize with the users of their products. UX Storytelling involves
            taking user data and repackaging it in a way that makes it clear and
            memorable, allowing UX designers to more effectively communicate
            insights from research and see things from users' perspective. It
            can be difficult to understand insights from raw data or bullet
            points — UX Storytelling instead communicates this information in a
            way that is memorable, easier to understand, and more likely to
            resonate, because storytelling is a powerful tool for communication.
            In this portion, I used UX storytelling as a way to understand how
            users use online resale markets. <br /><br />
            Based on the results of the prior research, I created two personas
            and empathy maps with the goal of understanding users' goals, needs,
            motivations, and pain points.

            In order to assess the usability of the design, I conducted a
            virtual usability test with the low-fidelity prototype. The
            participant was asked to complete a series of tasks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Search for an item and filter the search results.</li>
            <li>View your offers and show how to accept or deny them.</li>
            <li>View the items that you favorited.</li>

          <h2>High-Fidelity Design</h2>
          <p>
            For the high-fidelity design, I paid special attention to aspects
            such as design consistency, accessibility, and visual hierarchy.
            When designing the visual aesthetic of the app, my goal was to
            create a clean and cohesive interface design. I used a fairly
            limited color palette in order to prevent the interface's color from
            clashing with photos. The primary fonts are Montserrat and Helvetica
            Neue, with varying font weights. In order to ensure readability, I
            conducted contrast testing.

          <p>
            Following this, I conducted an impression test to assess users'
            immediate reaction to the design. This study was conducted
            virtually. The participant was given a link to view the wireframes,
            and asked about their initial reaction and thoughts. They were also
            asked to choose words to describe the app.<br /><br />In addition, I
            conducted a cognitive walkthrough to assess the usability of the app
            with a different participant. The participant was asked to
            walkthrough a series of tasks, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Search for an item and filter the search results.</li>
            <li>View and accept offers.</li>
            <li>Make a listing.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Based on the results of the impression test and cognitive
            walkthrough, the high fidelity prototype was successful in conveying
            the purpose and features offered by the application.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The most important takeaway was the importance of empathizing and
            seeing things from the perspective of users, rather than only
            relying on my own judgements. This was sometimes difficult because
            as a designer, I am used to following my own instincts. By getting
            feedback from users, whether it be from user research, usability
            testing, impression testing, and more, I was able to discover
            weaknesses in the product and gain insight on how to improve the
            overall experience of users.
